GlobeTrotter
– Empowering Personalized Travel Planning
Overall Vision
The overarching vision for GlobeTrotter is to become a personalized, intelligent, and
collaborative platform that transforms the way individuals plan and experience travel. The
platform aims to empower users to dream, design, and organize trips with ease by
offering an end-to-end travel planning tool that combines flexibility and interactivity.
It envisions a world where users can explore global destinations, visualize their journeys
through structured itineraries, make cost-effective decisions, and share their travel plans
within a community—making travel planning as exciting as the trip itself.
Mission
The mission for the hackathon team is to build a user-centric, responsive application that
simplifies the complexity of planning multi-city travel. The platform should provide
travelers with intuitive tools to:
● Add and manage travel stops and durations
● Explore cities and activities of interest
● Estimate trip budgets automatically
● Visualize timelines and plans
● Share trip plans with others
This involves constructing a solution that is both functional and insightful, powered by a
well-designed relational database and a smooth frontend experience. Teams must focus
on enabling users to organize personalized trips efficiently, stay within budget, and enjoy
full visibility of their journey.
Design and develop a complete travel planning application where users can:
● Create customized multi-city itineraries
● Assign travel dates, activities, and budgets
● Discover activities and destinations through search
● Receive cost breakdowns and visual calendars
● Share their plans publicly or with friends
The application must demonstrate proper use of relational databases to store and retrieve
complex travel data such as user-specific itineraries, stops, activities, and estimated
expenses. The system should also support dynamic user interfaces that adapt to each
user's trip flow.
